<p>Last September in Quito I participated in [Campus Party](http://www.campus-party.org/), a tech conference in Quito (Ecuador). One of the sessions that I run was a workshop on refactoring techniques. It consisted on a 15 minutes presentation explaining some basic concepts like unit tests, SOLID principle and TDD and a 45 minutes of practice with some exercises.</p>
<br/>
<p>This type of workshop is supposed to be run on a 3 hours session but we only had 1 hour so we focus on two SOLID principles (single responsability and Open/Closed). I'll be posting a more details explanation of each of the principles but for now, here you have the presentations (both in Spanish and English).</p>
