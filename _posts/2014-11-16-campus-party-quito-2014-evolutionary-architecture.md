[Campus Party](http://www.campus-party.org/) is a "technology festival" lasting a week that aims to provide an environment that promotes creativity, innovation and digital entertainment. The main attractions are talks, workshop and a REALLY fast internet connection. The festival was first hosted in Spain 15 years ago and now has editions in countries in Europe and Latin America.
<br/><br/>
My company (Thoughtworks) participated in this year [Ecuador edition](http://www.campus-party.com.ec/2014/index.html) that had as key speakers Karen M. Sandler and Julian Assange amongst others. We were in charge of the [coding zone](http://www.campus-party.com.ec/2014/Coding_Zone_2014.html) and we spent 3 days giving technical talks and encouraging people to learn more via hands-on workshops.
<br/><br/>
One of the talks that I gave was on Evolutionary Architecture and how this approach can help building more robust and easier to change applications. My pair on the talk [Fausto de la Torre](http://faustodelatog.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/arquitecturas-evolutivas/) uploaded the [slides](http://faustodelatog.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/arquitecturas-evolutivas/) of the talk.
<br/><br/>
DISCLAIMER: the slides are in Spanish. I'll convert them into English and upload that version soon.
